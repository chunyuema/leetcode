# Leetcode

This repository contains coding interview questions and their solutions in different languages. I am mostly adding Java and C++ solutions to this repository.

## Usage

Thie repository organizes source code only. In the following two notion pages, I organized the questions based on data structure, algorithm, techniques, level of difficulties. Please refer to them if you would like to prepare for interviews, or if you would like to learn about algorithms / data structure:

- Algorithms [Notion Page](https://chunyuema.notion.site/Algorithms-8fbfe977e63647098229b1c258d76cd6?pvs=4)
- Data Structures [Notion Page](https://chunyuema.notion.site/Data-Structures-c31688e4a1bc43539afd07f657ec87aa?pvs=4)

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

I would love to get help with coding solutions in other programming languages. Please reach out if you would like to contribute.
